# Community Errand Sharing â€” MVP

A tiny Flask web app that lets a small community:
- Post trips to villages/stores
- Request items from specific stores
- Claim & fulfill requests when doing a trip
- Record deliveries
- Automatically track balances (who owes whom) based on delivered items
- Record payments to settle balances
